# Interactive Systems Design and Technology Final Project
## By Stephanie Wong and Lia Johansen


We created a web application that shows users recipes and New York Times articles. In many recipes,

We utilized two APIs: Edamam and New York Times. Users are able to search for a key word such as ramen or holiday cookies and then are shown
recipes and articles pertaining to their search. They can cook and bake and then while eating or waiting for their food to cook users can read
the interesting articles.
