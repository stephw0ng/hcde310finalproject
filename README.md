# Interactive Systems Design and Technology Final Project
## By Stephanie Wong and Lia Johansen


We created a web application that shows users recipes and New York Times articles. The goal of our application is to help users learn more about the meals they're making. This can apply to food connoisseurs who want to read more about the food they're cooking, people looking to learn more about a new diet, or those looking to expand their knowledge in their free time. 

We utilized two APIs: Edamam and New York Times. Users are able to search for a key word, such as ramen or holiday cookies, and then are shown
recipes and articles pertaining to their search. While eating or waiting for their food to cook, users can read the interesting articles.

We also wanted to ensure that our web application met different dietary needs and interests. Therefore, we give users the options to filter their recipe results by dietary restrictions, sort the results from both APIs, and choose how many results they are shown.
